"""
Divisors  
Exercise 4 (and Solution)
Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number.
 (If you donâ€™t know what a divisor is, 
it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)
