Coding exercises for practice 


Starting out with the following websites:

https://www.practicepython.org/

https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/

https://pynative.com/python-exercises-with-solutions/

https://codingbat.com/python

Naming convension for files: [website][q#] 

Start of each file will be the question title 

I will try to do every exercise once with no help, once finding a "better" solution 

Any exercise that is difficult or gives me trouble enough that it takes more than a day to solve, I'll mark with [hard] in the file name. 

I will also keep track of whatever I'm learning either by updating this README or by taking notes using Evernote or Obsidian.
